# Welcome to my Github page!

- 👋 Hi, I’m @Kyldabeb.

- 👨‍🎓 I am currently pursuing a B.S. degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering.
- 🖥️ Currently updating and expanding my Github repository with most of the work I have done in the past. Besides school work.
  - ⚒️ I am currently assisting with a project for the Walter Scott, Jr. College of Engineering, updating a new OnDemand page to be more on brand for Colorado State University.
  - ⚙️ I am currently a part of a project that we are constructing and coding a deadbolt lock to work with facial recognition using machine learning, using OpenCV and the COCO Libraries.
  - 🗄️ I am currently building my own server through old server parts provided by friends and family, haven't decided what OS to put on it, yet . . .
